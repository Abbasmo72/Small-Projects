# File Operations

1. <b>Cerate PDF :</b>
This code creates a graphical application using the Tkinter library in Python, allowing users to generate PDF files. Users can input their desired text into a text box, and by clicking a button, the program generates a PDF file. The ReportLab library is utilized to create the PDF, with support for Persian fonts. The entered text is retrieved from the text box and written line by line into the PDF, managing page positions dynamically. This program is suitable for creating simple textual documents with Persian language support.

2. <b>Chek Code Python :</b>
This program creates a graphical interface using the Tkinter library, allowing users to check the syntax validity of Python code. It utilizes the ast module to parse the code and identify syntax errors, reporting any issues along with the line number to the user. Line numbers are displayed in a separate, non-editable text box and are automatically updated whenever the code text changes. Two text boxes are arranged side by side: one for line numbers and the other for the user to input code. Using the "Check Syntax" button, users can validate their code and view the results.<br>

# Network Utilities
1. <b>Get IP :</b> This Python code is designed to fetch and display the user's public IP address. It uses the urllib.request library to send a request to the ipify API service, retrieving the user's IP in text format. If the request is successful, the public IP is printed to the console. In case of any error, an appropriate error message is displayed. The script is executable as a standalone program, controlled through the if __name__ == "__main__": block.<br>

2. <b>SSL Shield :</b>The above code defines a function named is_secure_website that checks whether a website is secure using HTTPS. The function sends an HTTP request to the provided URL using the requests library and validates the certificate with the help of the certifi library. If the request is successful and the URL starts with https, the website is considered secure. In case of any errors, such as an invalid URL or connection issues, the website is deemed insecure. Finally, the user can input a website URL and see the result printed on the console.<br>

# System Oprations
1. <b>Alarm Battrey :</b>The program uses the psutil and pygame libraries to monitor the battery status and power connection, playing an alert if necessary. The pygame.mixer.init initializes the sound playback setup. In an infinite loop, the program checks the battery and power connection status; if the power is disconnected, it continuously plays the sg.mp3 sound file. When the power is reconnected, the alarm playback stops. The status is checked every second.<br>

2. <b>Battery Monitor :</b>The code first retrieves battery information using the psutil.sensors_battery() function and checks if the information is available. If battery data exists, it prints the battery percentage and whether the device is plugged into power. A function named convertTime is defined to convert the remaining battery time from seconds to the format hours:minutes:seconds. The remaining battery time is then displayed using this function. If no battery information is available, it prints "No battery information available."<br>
