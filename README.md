# File Operations

1. <b>Cerate PDF :</b>
This code creates a graphical application using the Tkinter library in Python, allowing users to generate PDF files. Users can input their desired text into a text box, and by clicking a button, the program generates a PDF file. The ReportLab library is utilized to create the PDF, with support for Persian fonts. The entered text is retrieved from the text box and written line by line into the PDF, managing page positions dynamically. This program is suitable for creating simple textual documents with Persian language support.

2. <b>Chek Code Python :</b>
This program creates a graphical interface using the Tkinter library, allowing users to check the syntax validity of Python code. It utilizes the ast module to parse the code and identify syntax errors, reporting any issues along with the line number to the user. Line numbers are displayed in a separate, non-editable text box and are automatically updated whenever the code text changes. Two text boxes are arranged side by side: one for line numbers and the other for the user to input code. Using the "Check Syntax" button, users can validate their code and view the results.<br>

# Network Utilities
1. <b>Get IP :</b> This Python code is designed to fetch and display the user's public IP address. It uses the urllib.request library to send a request to the ipify API service, retrieving the user's IP in text format. If the request is successful, the public IP is printed to the console. In case of any error, an appropriate error message is displayed. The script is executable as a standalone program, controlled through the if __name__ == "__main__": block.<br>
