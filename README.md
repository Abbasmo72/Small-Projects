# File Operations
1. <b>Cerate PDF :</b>
This code creates a graphical application using the Tkinter library in Python, allowing users to generate PDF files. Users can input their desired text into a text box, and by clicking a button, the program generates a PDF file. The ReportLab library is utilized to create the PDF, with support for Persian fonts. The entered text is retrieved from the text box and written line by line into the PDF, managing page positions dynamically. This program is suitable for creating simple textual documents with Persian language support.

2. <b>Chek Code Python :</b>
This program creates a graphical interface using the Tkinter library, allowing users to check the syntax validity of Python code. It utilizes the ast module to parse the code and identify syntax errors, reporting any issues along with the line number to the user. Line numbers are displayed in a separate, non-editable text box and are automatically updated whenever the code text changes. Two text boxes are arranged side by side: one for line numbers and the other for the user to input code. Using the "Check Syntax" button, users can validate their code and view the results.<br>

# Network Utilities
1. <b>Get IP :</b> This Python code is designed to fetch and display the user's public IP address. It uses the urllib.request library to send a request to the ipify API service, retrieving the user's IP in text format. If the request is successful, the public IP is printed to the console. In case of any error, an appropriate error message is displayed. The script is executable as a standalone program, controlled through the if __name__ == "__main__": block.<br>

2. <b>SSL Shield :</b>The above code defines a function named is_secure_website that checks whether a website is secure using HTTPS. The function sends an HTTP request to the provided URL using the requests library and validates the certificate with the help of the certifi library. If the request is successful and the URL starts with https, the website is considered secure. In case of any errors, such as an invalid URL or connection issues, the website is deemed insecure. Finally, the user can input a website URL and see the result printed on the console.<br>

3. <b>NetSpeed :</b>This Python script measures the network bandwidth by calculating the download and upload speeds. It uses psutil to get the initial and updated network statistics, then calculates the difference in bytes received and sent over a 1-second interval. The results are printed in kilobytes per second. The script also tracks the time taken to measure the bandwidth for performance insight.<br>

# System Oprations
1. <b>Alarm Battrey :</b>The program uses the psutil and pygame libraries to monitor the battery status and power connection, playing an alert if necessary. The pygame.mixer.init initializes the sound playback setup. In an infinite loop, the program checks the battery and power connection status; if the power is disconnected, it continuously plays the sg.mp3 sound file. When the power is reconnected, the alarm playback stops. The status is checked every second.<br>

2. <b>Battery Monitor :</b>The code first retrieves battery information using the psutil.sensors_battery() function and checks if the information is available. If battery data exists, it prints the battery percentage and whether the device is plugged into power. A function named convertTime is defined to convert the remaining battery time from seconds to the format hours:minutes:seconds. The remaining battery time is then displayed using this function. If no battery information is available, it prints "No battery information available."<br>

3. <b>CpuGuardian :</b>The provided code is a CPU monitoring program that utilizes the psutil library. The CpuMonitor class is designed with two main attributes: max_usage to define the maximum acceptable CPU usage and check_interval to set the interval between checks. The check_cpu_usage method monitors and displays the current CPU usage, while the monitor_cpu method continuously tracks CPU usage and triggers an alert if it exceeds the defined threshold, invoking the take_action method to manage the situation. The take_action method identifies high CPU-consuming processes, displays their details, and optionally terminates them if necessary. In the main program section (__main__), an instance of the class is created with customizable settings, and monitoring begins. This program effectively monitors and optimizes CPU usage in real time.<br>

4. <b> Disk Space :</b>The psutil library is imported to access system information. Then, the get_disk_usage function is defined to retrieve disk information, including total space, used space, free space, and percentage of used space, using the disk_usage method. The total, used, and free spaces are converted from bytes to gigabytes for better readability. The disk information is then printed in a formatted manner, and finally, the function get_disk_usage is executed if the script is run directly by checking the __name__ == "__main__" condition.<br>

5. <b> PythonFileFinder :</b>
The os and tkinter libraries are imported for file management and GUI creation. The search_files function searches directories for files with a specific extension like .py. In the on_search_button_click function, the file name is retrieved from the input, and a warning is shown if it's empty. Then, .py files are searched, filtered for the search term, and displayed in the Listbox; if no files are found, an information message is shown. Finally, root.mainloop runs the GUI, starting the application.<br>

# Web Scripts
1. <b>Find Table :</b> This code is a simple web scraping tool that uses Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas to extract table data from a website. First, it fetches the HTML content of a webpage using requests.get. Then, it parses the content with BeautifulSoup to identify tables with the class wikitable. Each extracted table is converted into a DataFrame using pandas.read_html. Finally, these tables can be saved as CSV files for further analysis. This code is highly useful for collecting structured data from web pages.<br>
