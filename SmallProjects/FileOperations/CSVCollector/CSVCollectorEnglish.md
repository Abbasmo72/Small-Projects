### Analysis of the CSV File Combination Program
This program is designed to merge multiple CSV files from a specified directory into a single output file. It is particularly useful for projects requiring the consolidation of data from various sources, such as financial records, daily reports, or sensor data. Below is a detailed analysis of the program:

## 1. Core Features
- <b>CSV File Detection:</b> The program identifies all CSV files in a specified directory, enabling automatic processing of various data files.
- <b>Data Merging:</b> Files are read sequentially and combined into a single dataset using pandas. The merging process ensures the structure of the data is preserved through proper reindexing.
- <b>Output Saving:</b> The final merged data is saved into a new CSV file, ready for further analysis or processing.
