### Analysis of the PDF Image Extraction Program
This program, written in Python, extracts images from PDF files and saves them to a specified folder. Below is a detailed analysis of the program, divided into its main components and functionality.

## 1. Purpose and Functionality
The program allows users to select a PDF file through a simple graphical user interface, extracts images from the pages of the file, and saves the images in a designated folder. It also provides a summary of the process upon completion.

## 2. Libraries Used
- os: Manages file paths and directory creation.
- tkinter: Provides a GUI for file selection.
- PyPDF2: Reads and parses the structure of PDF files and extracts image objects.
- Pillow (PIL): Converts binary image data into savable image files.
- io: Handles binary data and in-memory processing.

## 3. Structure and Main Components
- extract_images_from_pdf Function ، This is the core function of the program responsible for extracting and saving images. It performs the following steps:
    - Verifies the existence of the output folder and creates it if necessary.
    - Opens the PDF file and iterates through its pages.
    - Identifies and extracts image resources from each page.
    - Converts binary image data into savable formats (e.g., PNG).
    - Saves the images to the output folder and handles exceptions in case of errors.
- select_pdf_and_extract_images Function ، This function handles user interaction:
    - Displays a dialog box for selecting a PDF file.
    - Determines the output folder path for saving images.
    - Calls the extract_images_from_pdf function to process the selected file.
- Main Execution Block:
    - The script checks if it is being executed directly. If so, it initiates the file selection and image extraction process.
