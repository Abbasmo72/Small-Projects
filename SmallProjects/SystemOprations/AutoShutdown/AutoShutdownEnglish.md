### Auto Shutdown
The provided Python code is a utility script designed to schedule a system shutdown after a user-specified delay. It employs two core modules, os and time, to interact with the operating system and manage delays, respectively. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of its functionality:
#### Purpose
The script allows users to specify a time delay (in minutes), after which the system shuts down automatically. It is compatible with major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Components and Workflow
1. Module Importation:
   - The os module is used to execute operating system-specific commands for shutting down.
   - The time module is employed to introduce a delay before executing the shutdown command.
2. User Interaction:
   - The program prompts the user to input the desired delay time in minutes. This input is expected to be an integer.
3. Conversion and Validation:
   - The input in minutes is converted into seconds to facilitate compatibility with the time.sleep function.
   - Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values, ensuring the program does not crash.
4. Delay Execution:
   - The time.sleep function pauses the script's execution for the specified duration, effectively acting as a countdown..
