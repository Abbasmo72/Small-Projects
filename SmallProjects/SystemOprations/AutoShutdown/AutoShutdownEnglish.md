### Auto Shutdown
The provided Python code is a utility script designed to schedule a system shutdown after a user-specified delay. It employs two core modules, os and time, to interact with the operating system and manage delays, respectively. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of its functionality:
#### Purpose
The script allows users to specify a time delay (in minutes), after which the system shuts down automatically. It is compatible with major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Components and Workflow
1. Module Importation:
   - The os module is used to execute operating system-specific commands for shutting down.
   - The time module is employed to introduce a delay before executing the shutdown command.
2. User Interaction:
   - The program prompts the user to input the desired delay time in minutes. This input is expected to be an integer.
3. Conversion and Validation:
   - The input in minutes is converted into seconds to facilitate compatibility with the time.sleep function.
   - Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values, ensuring the program does not crash.
4. Delay Execution:
   - The time.sleep function pauses the script's execution for the specified duration, effectively acting as a countdown..
5. Shutdown Logic:
   - The script determines the operating system type using os.name.
   - Based on the detected OS:
        - For Windows, it uses the command shutdown /s /t 1 to shut down the system.
        - For Linux/macOS, the command shutdown -h now is executed.
   - A fallback mechanism alerts the user if the operating system is unsupported.
6. Error Handling:
   - If the user provides invalid input, such as non-numeric characters, a friendly error message is displayed, and the program exits gracefully.

## Strengths
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: The script supports both Windows and Unix-like systems, broadening its usability.
- Error Handling: The implementation of exception handling (try-except) ensures the program remains robust against invalid user inputs.
- Simplicity: The code is straightforward and easy to understand, making it accessible even to novice programmers.

## Conclusion
This Python script is a simple yet effective utility for automating system shutdowns. Its cross-platform design and error handling make it a reliable tool for scheduling power-offs. However, integrating advanced features such as cancellation and user prompts would significantly improve its functionality and user experience.

## Python Code

```python
import os
import time

def schedule_shutdown():
    try:
        # Get the shutdown delay from the user (in minutes)
        minutes = int(input("Enter the time in minutes until the system shuts down: "))
        # Convert minutes to seconds
        seconds = minutes * 60

        print(f"The system will shut down in {minutes} minutes...")
        time.sleep(seconds)  # Wait for the specified duration

        # Execute the shutdown command based on the operating system
        if os.name == "nt":  # Windows
            os.system("shutdown /s /t 1")
        elif os.name == "posix":  # Linux/Mac
            os.system("shutdown -h now")
        else:
            print("Your operating system is not supported.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    schedule_shutdown()

```
