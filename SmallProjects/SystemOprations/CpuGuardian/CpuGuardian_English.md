## Analysis of the CPU Monitoring Code
This Python code is designed to monitor CPU usage and take action when it exceeds a defined threshold. Below is a detailed analysis of its structure and functionality:

## Overall Structure
1. Libraries Used:
   - psutil: A library for accessing system information such as CPU, memory, and processes.
   - time: Used for time delays and managing intervals between checks.
2. CpuMonitor Class:
   - This class handles CPU monitoring and responding to high usage scenarios. It includes methods for monitoring and taking necessary actions.

## Methods Breakdown
1. __init__:
   - Inputs:
     - max_usage: Maximum CPU usage threshold (in percentage). Default is 80%.
     - check_interval: Interval (in seconds) between checks. Default is 1 second.
   - This method initializes the object with configurable parameters for monitoring.
2. check_cpu_usage:
   - Checks the current CPU usage over the specified interval (check_interval).
   - Output: Returns the current CPU usage percentage.
   - Note: It uses the cpu_percent method from the psutil library to calculate CPU usage.
3. monitor_cpu:
   - Continuously monitors CPU usage in a loop.
   - If the usage exceeds the defined threshold, it triggers a warning and calls the take_action method.
   - Features:
     - Uses an infinite loop to continuously check CPU usage.
     - Delays between checks using time.sleep.
4. take_action:
   - This method is invoked when CPU usage exceeds the threshold.
   - Functionality:
     - Identifies processes consuming more than 20% of CPU.
     - Displays details of these processes, including their PID, name, and CPU usage.
     - Provides an optional feature to terminate high CPU-consuming processes (commented out by default).

## How the Program Works
- The program starts when the script is executed.
- An instance of the CpuMonitor class is created with the specified threshold and interval.
- The monitor_cpu method is called to begin continuous monitoring.
- By default, it checks CPU usage every second and raises an alert if usage exceeds 80%.

## Advantages of the Program
1. Modularity:
   - Each method has a distinct responsibility, enhancing readability and maintainability.
2. Flexibility:
   - Parameters like max_usage and check_interval can be easily customized.
3. Detailed Information:
   - It identifies and displays high CPU-consuming processes with relevant details.
4. System Interaction:
   - Leverages the psutil library to manage system processes efficiently.

## Areas for Improvement
1. Graceful Exit:
   - Currently, the monitoring loop runs indefinitely without a mechanism for safe termination. Adding support for interrupt handling (e.g., CTRL+C) or signals could enhance usability.
2. Automated Action:
   - The take_action method currently only logs high CPU processes. Implementing features like automatic termination of specific processes or sending notifications could improve functionality.
3. Logging:
   - Instead of printing messages to the console, using the logging library to save logs would provide better traceability.
4. Process Safety:
   - Terminating processes might cause system instability. The program should ensure that only non-critical processes are terminated.
5. Graphical Interface:
   - Adding a simple GUI to visualize CPU usage could make the program more user-friendly.

## Use Cases
- Monitoring CPU usage on personal computers or servers.
- Identifying resource-intensive processes to optimize system performance.
- Managing resources in high-load environments.
