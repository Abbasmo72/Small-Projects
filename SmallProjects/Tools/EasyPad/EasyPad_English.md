## Simple Note-Taking Application with Text File Storage
The program is a simple note-taking application that allows users to add, view, and delete notes. It uses a file named notes.txt as the storage medium. Here's an overview of its functionality:
1. Note Storage: Notes are stored in a file called notes.txt. If the file doesn’t exist, it is created automatically.
2. Reading Notes: The program checks if the notes file exists before reading. If the file exists, its contents are read, and the notes are returned as a list.
3. Adding Notes: Users can add new notes by entering them through the interface. The new note is appended to the file, and a success message is displayed.
4. Viewing Notes: All stored notes are displayed with their respective numbers. If no notes are available, the program informs the user that there are no notes to display.
5. Deleting Notes: Users can delete a specific note by entering its number. The program validates the input, removes the note from the list, and rewrites the file without the deleted note. If an invalid number or incorrect input is provided, an error message is shown.
6. Main Menu: The program has a main menu with four options:
   - Add a note
   - View notes
   - Delete a note
   - Exit the program
7. Error Handling: The program includes error handling to ensure smooth operation. For instance, it displays appropriate messages when a user inputs invalid options or numbers.
8. Main Loop: A continuous loop displays the main menu and processes the user’s input. The loop ends when the user selects the "Exit" option.

This program is a simple yet effective tool for managing notes. It operates entirely through text files and provides a good exercise for beginners learning Python fundamentals.

## Python Code
```python
import os

# Path for storing the notes file
NOTES_FILE = "notes.txt"  # File name to store notes

# Function to read notes from the file
def read_notes():
    if not os.path.exists(NOTES_FILE):  # If the file doesn't exist, return an empty list
        return []
    
    with open(NOTES_FILE, "r") as file:  # Open the file in read mode
        notes = file.readlines()  # Read all lines from the file
    return [note.strip() for note in notes]  # Remove extra spaces and return the notes

# Function to add a new note
def add_note(note):
    with open(NOTES_FILE, "a") as file:  # Open the file in append mode
        file.write(note + "\n")  # Write the note to the file
    print("Note added successfully.")  # Success message after adding the note

# Function to display all notes
def display_notes():
    notes = read_notes()  # Read the notes from the file
    if not notes:  # If no notes are available
        print("No notes available.")  # Message if no notes are found
    else:
        print("\nYour Notes:")  # Display the title for the notes
        for i, note in enumerate(notes, 1):  # Iterate and display each note
            print(f"{i}. {note}")

# Function to delete a note
def delete_note(index):
    notes = read_notes()  # Read the notes from the file
    if index < 1 or index > len(notes):  # Check if the note number is valid
        print("Invalid note number.")  # Error message for invalid number
        return

    del notes[index - 1]  # Delete the specified note
    with open(NOTES_FILE, "w") as file:  # Open the file in write mode
        for note in notes:  # Write the remaining notes to the file
            file.write(note + "\n")
    print("Note deleted successfully.")  # Success message after deleting the note

# Main menu loop for the program
def main():
    while True:
        print("\nSimple Note Taking App")  # Displaying the app title
        print("1. Add Note")  # Option to add a note
        print("2. View Notes")  # Option to view notes
        print("3. Delete Note")  # Option to delete a note
        print("4. Exit")  # Option to exit the program

        choice = input("Choose an option: ")  # Getting the user's choice for an option

        if choice == '1':  # If the user chooses option 1
            note = input("Enter your note: ")  # Get the new note from the user
            add_note(note)  # Add the note to the file
        elif choice == '2':  # If the user chooses option 2
            display_notes()  # Display all the notes
        elif choice == '3':  # If the user chooses option 3
            display_notes()  # Display all the notes
            try:
                index = int(input("Enter the note number to delete: "))  # Get the note number to delete
                delete_note(index)  # Delete the specified note
            except ValueError:  # If the input is not a valid number
                print("Please enter a valid number.")  # Error message for invalid input
        elif choice == '4':  # If the user chooses option 4
            print("Exiting the program.")  # Message for exiting the program
            break
        else:  # If the user enters an invalid option
            print("Invalid option. Please try again.")  # Error message for invalid option

if __name__ == "__main__":  # Ensures the script runs only when executed directly
    main()
