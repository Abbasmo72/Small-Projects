## Simple Countdown Timer in Python with Minute-Second Display
This code is a simple countdown timer in Python that displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds format and prints a message when the timer ends.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. Importing the time Module:
   - The time module is used to introduce delays in the program with the time.sleep() function.
2. countdown_timer Function:
   - Input: The total countdown duration in seconds (seconds).
   - Functionality:
        - Uses a while loop to run the countdown.
       - Converts the total seconds into minutes and seconds using the divmod() function.
       - Displays the remaining time in the MM:SS format.
       - Uses end="\r" to overwrite the same line in the console for updating the timer dynamically.
       - Introduces a delay of one second with time.sleep(1) and decrements the seconds value.
   - When the countdown reaches zero, it prints the message "Time's up!".
3. Getting User Input:
   - The program asks the user to input the countdown duration in seconds and passes it to the countdown_timer function as an argument.

### Key Features:
   - The program accurately displays the time and is suitable for basic timer functionalities.
   - Formatting with {mins:02d} and {secs:02d} ensures that minutes and seconds are displayed in two-digit format.
   - The end="\r" parameter ensures that the countdown updates dynamically on a single line in the console.

### Improvements:
   - A graphical user interface (GUI) or an audible alert could be added for better user experience.
   - Input validation for non-numeric or negative values could enhance the program's robustness.

### Python Code
```python
import time

def countdown_timer(seconds):
    while seconds > 0:
        mins, secs = divmod(seconds, 60)  # Convert seconds to minutes and seconds
        timer = f"{mins:02d}:{secs:02d}"
        print(timer, end="\r")  # Display the time on a single line
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for one second
        seconds -= 1
    
    print("Time's up!")

# Input the countdown duration (in seconds)
duration = int(input("Enter the countdown duration (in seconds): "))
countdown_timer(duration)
```
